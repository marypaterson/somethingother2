I spoke to John Ellngsworth today, from Sideshow Magazine (amongst many other things) http://sideshow-circusmagazine.com/.  He is developing a number of interesting projects around digital journalism, digital writing and online learning.  I told him what we are doing with this space, and the principle of the 'Open Room.'  And I invited him to join us in the room - to observe, contribute, or both.
