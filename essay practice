So...
we seem to be trying to write a conversation back into github space/time // [MP] I see that now
which doesn't really do conversation // [MP] It depends what a conversation is. I am enjoying this feeling that I can play with your words back in time, swim through them, back and forth
as maddy despairs // [MP] Yesterday Maddy and I were on the train together, both despairing.  We  felt lost.
I'm feeling that I should really be re-writing code // [MP] I like the lexicon of code: languages, syntax, grammar. I like how pedantic code is.  How it tells you when it's upset, and takes things literally, like a child
in these lines 
rather than
words. // [MP] After 2008 Ross started working with a lot of programmers who don't speak English as a first language - people travelling from southern Europe and Asia to find work in London. I had assumed that programming languages were written in native languages, but of course they're not. They're all written in a kind of international, abbreviated, American English. 
[MP} I am probably wrong about that ^^, but at least that's how I understood it to be possible that people who can't speak the same language (e.g. English) can code together fluently 
What would happen if we stopped trying to 
converse in writing
and instead coded without writing code
without trying to imitate its lexical feel // [MP} Without trying to imitate code's lexical feel?
on a superficial level
OK, then but then
that is probably what poetry
is
or was
or could be
Duh!
