(MP) Ross just deleted a document of mine 'to show you what versioning means.'

It was a lightbulb moment for me.

I realised that we don't have to use thiis repository like a shared document

We can use it, instead, like a shared history. We can overwrite each other's words, bring up a blank new page, start again
... and nevertheless create a communal memory of what came before (click on 'history' to read what I deleted)

I think I have *just* understood the point of github, and how it might offer us something more than just an awkward way to have a conversation
(The commit changes comment box is essential, too ...)

With 30 seconds left before I have to fo, I have started to get excited about the possibilities of this space!
