Karen Christopher and Chris Goode are in residence at Roehampton this week, and as part of the residency they are having open hours from 11am until 5pm from Tuesday-Friday. I wasn't in yesterday, so today was the first day I've gone in during these open hours. I entered the room right as they were about to break and go get a sandwich. I asked how they were doing. Karen said she has a hard time not responding when someone comes in the room, even though she might want to just carry on with what she is doing. Chris said that he is 'either extraordinarily calm or extraordinarily stupid' and so he is less affected by people. 
I'm thinking about open rooms, and how things become and/or remain open, and whether a commitment to openness means that the resulting work is necessarily in some sense *about* openness as well. 
I've been thinking, as well about closed rooms. On a feminist listserve that I'm on, there has recently been some discussion about levels of privacy posts to the list should enjoy. Ground rules have been put in place that messages posted to the list should not be forwarded without the author's permission, and discussions that occur on the list should not be referenced in public. People post about senstive and difficult things, which is indeed the value of the list for a lot of people, so the decision has been taken we should attempt a level of privacy. This comment may in fact constitute a violation of the groundrules, I'm not sure.
Open rooms can also have obstacles. Working in this Github space, where the rules are unfamiliar, and the remit is undefined or emergent, the 'space' feels open but also like I might step on or in something I might prefer not to.

I wrote about open rooms but it was all lost!  Time has been taken away from me - I was writing about the incessant time of the internet v. the expansive time of a library, and of the rules of an open room, but it's all just memory now ....I have run out of time, I will have to try to remember and come back later
